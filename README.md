# BonAppleTea(Angular)
Led a team of five in developing an Angular-based point-of-sale system for a local company in College Station. As the team leader, I focused on designing the database schema and full-stack development, particularly enhancing UI accessibility features and managing query connections to our Express server. I created and hosted a database instance to support a real-time web application with a 0.6-second frontend reflection delay. 

Our tech stack included SQL, Express, Angular for faster tunneling through school servers, and asynchronous Google Cloud Functions and Firebase for hosting the real-time instance. I also led scrum meetings, managed Jira, and mentored new web developers on the team.
